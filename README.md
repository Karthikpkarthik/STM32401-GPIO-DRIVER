## Introduction

This GPIO driver is developed for the STM32F401 series of microcontrollers and is designed to facilitate GPIO peripheral configuration and control. It allows you to configure and manage GPIO pins and ports efficiently. The driver supports setting pin modes, configuring pull-up/pull-down resistors, setting pin speeds, and configuring pin output types.

## Supported Functions

### 1. GPIO_PerClkContrl
- Function to enable or disable the peripheral clock of a specific GPIO port.
- Parameters:
  - GPIO base address
  - Enable (EN) or Disable (DI) the peripheral clock

### 2. GPIO_Init
- Function to configure various GPIO pin settings, such as mode, speed, pull-up/pull-down, output type, and alternate function.
- Parameter: GPIO_handler_t structure containing pin configuration.

### 3. GPIO_DeInit
- Function to deinitialize a GPIO port by resetting its configuration settings.
- Parameter: GPIO base address

### 4. GPIO_ReadFromInputPin
- Function to read the input state of a specific GPIO pin.
- Parameters:
  - GPIO base address
  - Pin number (1 to 16)
- Returns: 8-bit value (GPIO_PIN_SET or GPIO_PIN_RESET)

### 5. GPIO_ReadFromInputPort
- Function to read the input state of an entire GPIO port.
- Parameter: GPIO base address
- Returns: 16-bit value (port input state)

### 6. GPIO_WriteToOutputPin
- Function to set or reset an output value for a specific GPIO pin.
- Parameters:
  - GPIO base address
  - Pin number (1 to 16)
  - GPIO_PIN_SET or GPIO_PIN_RESET

### 7. GPIO_WriteToOutputPort
- Function to write a 16-bit value to an entire GPIO port.
- Parameters:
  - GPIO base address
  - 16-bit value

### 8. GPIO_ToggleOutputPin
- Function to toggle the output state of a specific GPIO pin.
- Parameters:
  - GPIO base address
  - Pin number (1 to 16)

Please note that some IRQ-related functions are also mentioned but currently left unimplemented.

## Usage

To use this GPIO driver, you can include the provided header files in your STM32F401xx project and make calls to the functions listed above as needed for your application. More information and examples on how to use the functions can be found within the source code.
